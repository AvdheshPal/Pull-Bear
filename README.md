<h2>About Project</h2>
<p>
    Project has been given to us in 2nd unit in masai school. The Project is about to clone the Pull & Bear shoping site. "Pull & Bear" is a spanish brand, who deals with cloths, shoes, and etc.
</p>
<h2>Technologies used in Project</h2>
<p>
    We had used many technologies in our Project. We used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT for the basic structure of our website. We had also used LOCALSTORAGE in our website for transfer the data from one page to another pages.
</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>
    If anyone visits our site, first of all you get the home page where you can sign in or sign up if you don’t want to sign in, just skip that and go ahead. You will then land on the product page where you can select unique products like jeans, trousers, jackets, shoes, etc. There are so many other products and if you click them you can see all the details about them. If you wanted to buy them you can add them on “Cart” or you can directly buy them, after that you can select your payment options either you can select online payment or  cash on delivery. If you select online payment you have the options of credit or debit card , pay by phone pay, google pay, paypal etc.
